	<p> CHAPTER ONE: A SURREAL ENCOUNTER </p>
</div>
<div class="story">
	<p> It was raining slightly I wokeup at 7 am as usual and searched for my phone under my pillow opened it. A message was floating on the screen it was from my girlfriend. She said she wanted to meet and and we were up for a date so I wokeup took a bath everything was going normal picked up her favourite shirt to wear and got all dressed up. I went upto the bus stop,as usual after few minutes of waiting,the bus arrived at the stop and I got on. The travel was normal I arrived at the desired station and had to walk a little between the highway with forest on both sides. I was not alone there were few people walking with me it was strange we all were walking on the same pace. The group also had three monks. One of them looked to be their chief judging from his outfit. I was feeling uncomfortable to be among such person so I decided to put on my headphone  to avoid awkwardness. So I started listening to my favourite songs shuffling through my playlist. I looked back we were still at the same place walking in the same pace. I paused for a moment feeling bizzare and I noticed there was a certain breeze in the air, like the air has gotten thin. It froze my heart I was chilled to my spine, I was so scared that even being an introvert, my instict kicked and I went to ask the cheif monk if he has noticed something wierd and he replied,"I am hearing distant echoes." As soon as he said so the color of the sky turned pink the normal green forest turned into some fantasy wonderland but the group of people were still there. We all were shocked and worried I took out my phone from the pocket it showed no signal and the battery was draining by 1% each ten second. I gave a look around everyone was checking their phone I pinched myself to check if it is a dream but it wasn't. We all started being worried. I opened the camera of the phone to click the picture of such a bizzare thing but the shutter button was not working anymore no matter how many times I try it didn't work and within some minutes my phone died. I assumed we came into another dimensions but had no idea about how. The chief monk told us to calm down and asked us to form a circle and hold hands they also said we need to close our eyes. We did as he said and those monks started murmuring some strange mantras followed by the chief's matra, I was too scared to open and peek at them but one of us opened our eye in the middle of that mantra and as soon as it happened the bizzare forest started fading including the streets every thing was black and white with a distorted vision and the scenario was similar to blank screen of television I started panicking so did others. Everyone was panicking and I realised we were into another dimension again. It was even worse than before all we could see was each other after some minutes of panicking a hand grabbed me from behind and it was a stranger girl and all of a sudden with a blink of an eye we all stood in front of a strange house and we followed her into the house and there I met my friend from my school that I have lost contact with for like 6 or 7 years but he was still the same age like that in school. We had a small talk and I asked him if he wants to know about his future cause he was currently in australia. But he refused to know and I tapped his shoulder and said," That's the spirit bro." because if he did it might not be good for the future and all of a sudden a guy in a robe appeared in front of us from his face I could tell he was our english teacher from highschool but he wasn't able to recognise me. He had a steam of strange aura around him and his presence was so bold. He asked us our origins we told him all the truth and he promised us he would help us return to our dimension, so he asked to to form a circle and sit in certain points and if we try to run from the radius of those points he warned us we would fade away. My heart was pounding so hard that I could feel it in my temple and when I looked at those 3 monks, they were also shivering. After sometime I could feel my legs trembling and slowly my sensation of vision was fading away. All of a sudden I woke up in my bed my head was dizzy,breath was heavy and my vision was blurry, after sometime I was able to catch my breath and I checkd my phone to see what time it is, there was an unopened text and I clicked that just to see a text from my girlfriend "babe are you free tommorrow? Let's meet up at our favourite cafe!". A surreal chill circulated throughout my body and I got goosebumps after reading that.</p>
